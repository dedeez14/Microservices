## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd microservices

# Start all services
start-dev.bat  # Windows
# or
chmod +x start-dev.sh && ./start-dev.sh  # Linux/macOS

# Services will be available at:
# - API Gateway: http://localhost:3000
# - Warehouse Service: http://localhost:3001  
# - MongoDB: localhost:27017
# - Redis: localhost:6379
# - RabbitMQ Management: http://localhost:15672 (admin/admin123)
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Ensure MongoDB and Redis are running locally
# Then start services locally
start-local.bat  # Windows
# or
chmod +x start-local.sh && ./start-local.sh  # Linux/macOS
```

### Sample Data
```bash
# Seed sample data (3 warehouses, locations, inventory items)
docker-compose exec warehouse-service npm run seed

# Or if running locally
cd warehouse-service && npm run seed
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Test warehouse service
cd warehouse-service
npm test                    # All tests
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only

# Test API gateway
cd api-gateway
npm test
```
